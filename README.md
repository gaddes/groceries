## Setup

### Set Bash as default terminal on VSCode (optional but handy!)

### Git & Github
Using the Terminal in VSCode, navigate to the directory where you want to save this project (e.g. Users/MattGaddes/Projects)
Check your shell is running Bash, then type `git clone https://github.com/gaddes/groceries.git` (this step may fail if git isn't installed - see google!)
In Terminal, navigate to your newly-created project folder (`cd groceries`) then type `npm install` to install all packages and dependencies
Type `npm start` to fire up the development server - this will take a few seconds but should automatically open a new tab in Chrome and show our app!
Check out the files in VSCode - the only ones we'll be working on (for now!) are Home.js (JavaScript and HTML) and home.scss (CSS)

### Trello
This is just an easy way to break down tasks and keep track of what we're currently working on!
